Notes
    - Have the digit label check what the current state is and call each 
    label (waiting or entering) accordingly
    - All labels should return back to the main loop


Questions for TAs:
    - Since we can't rely on r5, r6, r7 holding what they're holding, can 
    we ever use them. For example what if the "==" operator changes their values?
    ** We tried and it resulted in undefined behavior
    - When can we ever reliably use them?
